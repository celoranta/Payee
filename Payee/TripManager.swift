    1. Create empty array of MemberRecords
    2. Take in an array of transactions. For each transaction, it will return all the MemberRecord objects
    3. Now we have array of all MemberRecords from all transactions.
     
     1. First create an empty Dictionary outside that looks like this (Buddy:(Tabs: Float?,Pays: Float?))
     2. Iterate through MemberRecord array and check if Buddy propery matches Dictionary key. If it doesnt exist, Dictionary[Buddy] = (0.0, 0.0). If it does exit, return and do the next one
     3. Now we should have a dictionary with all the Buddies that are found in these MemberRecords. All their .tabs, and .pays are 0.
     4. Iterate through the MemberRecord array for each Dictionary key. Update the tuple ".tab" and ".pays" variables by adding the new value to the old value.
     5. At the end of this, we should have a Dectionary with keys for all the Buddy objects. And each Buddy object has a tuple where the .tab is the full amount of debts, and the .pays is the full amount of expenses.
     6. Create a cell with the name as the dictionary key, and a label that shows the difference between the .tab totals and .pay totals.
     7. Return the cell to the TableViewController.
